# My-Conky-RC-File
Well, I got pretty into conky and made a bunch of these.  This ends up being my favorite.  This mine in Debian.

1. Install conky and weather-util
2. Put this file in your home directory renamed:  .conkyrc
3. Run conky (It now has a desktop file by defualt so you can just run it as an application).
4. Put Conky in the startup applications in Gnome Tweaks.  This does work in any window mangaer or system but I'm not going to write all that here (it has been tested in basically everything, though).

Thanks!
